If it’s good, it’s wonderful. If it’s bad, it is experience","If you have the power to make someone happy, do it. The world needs more of that","Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen","If we keep doing what we are doing, we’re going to keep getting what we’re getting","You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want","Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden","Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known","There are three ways to ultimate success: The first way is to be kind. The second way is to be kind. The third way is to be kind"];
